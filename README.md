**rsspub** is a self-hosted Rust application that turns your favorite RSS/Atom feeds/ Read Later articles into a personal daily newspaper (EPUB). It fetches articles, processes images, and bundles everything into an EPUB file that you can read on your e-reader or tablet.

It also serves an OPDS feed, making it easy to download the generated EPUBs directly to compatible readers (like KOReader, Moon+ Reader, etc.).

## Roadmap

- [x] Add email send option for Kindle
- [x] Add basic Read it later feature.
- [ ] Make it multi-platform via Tauri or Dioxus
- [x] Add configuration for few of the hardcoded settings
- [ ] Cleanup unused/unnecessary features
- [ ] Add user defined custom article extraction logic via Scrapper crate

## Features

- **Read It Later:** Save articles to read later. It will created different EPUB for read later articles and marked as read once epub is generated.
- **RSS/Atom Parsing:** Automatically fetches and parses content from your configured feeds.
- **EPUB Generation:** Compiles articles into a well-formatted EPUB ebook.
- **Image Optimization:** Downloads and processes images for optimal e-reader viewing (grayscale, resizing).
- **Web Interface:** A simple web UI to manage feeds, schedules, and manually trigger generation.
- **OPDS Catalog:** Built-in OPDS server (`/opds`) to browse and download generated EPUBs.
- **Scheduling:** Automated generation based on cron expressions.
- **Authentication:** Optional Basic Authentication to protect your instance.
- **Email Delivery:** Automatically send generated EPUBs to a configured email address.
- **Performance:** Built with Rust, Axum, and Tokio for high performance and low resource usage.
  
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable)
- (Optional) `libvips` if using the `mem_opt` feature for optimized image processing.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rsspub.git
    cd rsspub
    ```

2.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```
    The server will start at `http://0.0.0.0:3000`.

### Docker

You can also run **rsspub** using Docker Compose.

1.  Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.
2.  (Optional) Create a `.env` file to configure environment variables:
    ```env
    RPUB_USERNAME=your_username
    RPUB_PASSWORD=your_password
    EPUBS_HOST_DIR=./your_custom_db_dir # Defaults to ./db if not set
    ```
3.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
    The server will start at `http://localhost:3000`.

**Manual Build:**

To build the Docker image manually:

```bash
docker build -t rsspub .
```

To run the container:
```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v $(pwd)/data:/app/db rsspub
```

### Usage

1.  **Open the Web UI:** Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
2.  **Add Feeds:** Use the interface to add the RSS/Atom feed URLs you want to follow.
3.  **Generate EPUB:** Click the "Generate" button (or configure a schedule) to create an EPUB from the latest articles.
4.  **Download:**
    - **Direct Download:** Download generated EPUBs from the "Downloads" section in the UI.
    - **OPDS:** Add `http://<your-server-ip>:3000/opds` to your e-reader's OPDS catalog list.

### Email Configuration

You can configure the application to automatically send generated EPUBs via email (e.g., to your Send-to-Kindle address).

- **Gmail Configuration:** Tested with `smtp.gmail.com` on port `587`.
- **App Password:** If using Gmail, you must use an **App Password** (your regular password will not work).
- **Recommendation:** It is recommended to use a **temporary or dedicated email account** for this feature, rather than your primary personal account.

### Configuration

You can configure the application using environment variables:

-   `RPUB_USERNAME`: Set a username for Basic Authentication.
-   `RPUB_PASSWORD`: Set a password for Basic Authentication.

If these variables are set, the Web UI and API (except `/opds`) will require authentication.


### Read It Later

You can save individual articles to be included in your next daily EPUB delivery.

**Web UI:**
1.  Go to the "Read Later" tab.
2.  Paste the article URL and click "Add".

**Android Integration (HTTP Shortcuts):**
You can easily add articles from your Android phone using the [HTTP Shortcuts](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.rmy.android.http_shortcuts) app.

1.  **Install** the "HTTP Shortcuts" app.
2.  **Create a new shortcut**:
    -   **Name:** Add to rsspub
    -   **Method:** POST
    -   **URL:** `http://<your-server-ip>/read-it-later`
    -   **Body Type:** JSON
    -   **Body Content:**
        ```json
        {
          "url": "{share_text}"
        }
        ```
    -   *Note: `{share_text}` is a variable that will be replaced by the URL you share.*
3.  **Authentication (if enabled):**
    -   Go to "Authentication" section of the shortcut settings.
    -   Select "Basic Authentication".
    -   Enter your `RPUB_USERNAME` and `RPUB_PASSWORD`.
4.  **Usage:**
    -   When browsing an article in Chrome or any app, tap **Share**.
    -   Select **HTTP Shortcuts**.
    -   Select your **Add to rsspub** shortcut.

**Added sample rsspub_http_shortcuts.json which can be imported in the app**.   


**IOS Integration (Inbuild Shortcut):**
     <s>
    
### Building with Optimization (Optional) 

For better memory usage during image processing (recommended for low-memory devices), you can enable the `mem_opt` feature (requires `libvips` installed on your system):

cargo run --features mem_opt
</s>

### Alternatives

- **Calibre:** [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) also has a "Fetch News" feature that can download RSS feeds and convert them to EPUB/MOBI. It is a desktop application, whereas rsspub is designed to run as a server.
- **KindleEar:** [KindleEar](https://github.com/cdhigh/KindleEar) is a Calibre port that runs on web to aggregate RSS feeds and send them to your Kindle.(https://github.com/harshit181/KindleEar minor code change to enable opds server)

## Architecture

-   **Backend:** Rust (Axum, Tokio)
-   **Database:** SQLite (Rusqlite)
-   **Frontend:** Static HTML/CSS/JS served by Axum
-   **Image Processing:** `image` crate (default) or `libvips` (optional)
